# Breaking-SWG-with-LMRA
A simulation inspired by SquareX's research on Last Mile Reassembly Attacks (LMRA) to showcase how attackers can bypass Secure Web Gateways (SWG) using dynamic UI manipulation. Built for educational purposes to highlight web security vulnerabilities and encourage better defenses.

# Features
Static Background: A static login page image simulates a phishing or testing scenario.
HTML Input Fields: Basic input fields for email and password allow user interaction.
Submit Button: A simple button for data submission to simulate potential capture points.

# How It Works
Static Design: A background image is used to simulate the UI of a login page.
Input Handling: Basic HTML input fields for email and password are overlaid on the image to simulate user interaction.
Simulation Purpose: Demonstrates the concept of a phishing-style attack or testing bypasses for SWG protections.
