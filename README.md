# Breaking-SWG-with-LMRA
A simulation inspired by SquareX's research on Last Mile Reassembly Attacks (LMRA) to showcase how attackers can bypass Secure Web Gateways (SWG) using dynamic UI manipulation. Built for educational purposes to highlight web security vulnerabilities and encourage better defenses.

# Features
- Static Background: A static login page image simulates a phishing or testing scenario.
- HTML Input Fields: Basic input fields for email and password allow user interaction.
- Submit Button: A simple button for data submission to simulate potential capture points.

# How It Works
1. Static Design: A background image is used to simulate the UI of a login page.
2. Input Handling: Basic HTML input fields for email and password are overlaid on the image to simulate user interaction.
3. Simulation Purpose: Demonstrates the concept of a phishing-style attack or testing bypasses for SWG protections.

# Credits
This project is inspired by SquareX's demonstration on Breaking Secure Web Gateways (SWG) with Last Mile Reassembly Attacks (LMRA). It aims to replicate some aspects of the concept for educational purposes.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Breaking-SWG-with-LMRA.git
   cd Breaking-SWG-with-LMRA
   ```
2. Open index.html in your browser.

3. Replace background.png with your preferred login interface image, if needed.
